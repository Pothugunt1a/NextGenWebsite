# CPPanel Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Project built successfully (npm run build)
- [ ] All image files have 644 permissions
- [ ] Logo file (3dgifmaker34062.gif) displays correctly
- [ ] Dropdown images (IT-Services-dropdown.gif, AI-dropdown.png) display correctly
- [ ] No 403 errors when accessing images
- [ ] All static files (HTML, CSS, JS) have proper permissions

## Files to Upload to CPPanel
1. Upload contents of `dist/` directory to your cpanel public_html folder
2. Ensure the following critical files are present:
   - dist/index.js (server file)
   - dist/public/index.html (main HTML file)
   - dist/public/assets/ (all image and static assets)

## Critical Image Files to Verify
- Logo: assets/3dgifmaker34062.gif
- IT Services Dropdown: assets/IT-Services-dropdown.gif
- AI Dropdown: assets/AI-dropdown.png
- All other PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG files in assets/

## Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Website loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation dropdown images display without black backgrounds
- [ ] Logo appears at correct size on desktop/mobile
- [ ] All images load without 403 errors
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop

## Common Issues and Solutions
- 403 errors on images: Run chmod 644 on all image files
- Missing images: Verify file paths and permissions
- Broken dropdowns: Check image blend modes and CSS
- Logo too small: Verify responsive CSS is applied

## Emergency Commands
If images don't load after deployment:
1. SSH to cpanel and run: find public_html/assets -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.gif" -o -name "*.svg" | xargs chmod 644
2. Clear browser cache and test again
