# RTNextGenAI Marketing Website Project

## Overview

This project is a modern web application for an AI solutions company called RTNextGenAI. It features a marketing website with various sections including a hero banner, about section, solutions showcase, testimonials, and a contact form. The architecture follows a client-server approach with a React frontend and an Express.js backend.

The application uses the following key technologies:
- React with TypeScript for the frontend UI
- Express.js for the backend server
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
- wouter for routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- shadcn/ui component library based on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a customized theme
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
- TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with a clear separation of UI components, pages, and utilities. The UI is responsive and designed with a modern look and feel, featuring a color scheme of purple and orange as primary and secondary colors.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with:
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL as the database (configuration ready)
- RESTful API endpoints

The backend is minimalistic but extensible, currently providing an API endpoint for contact form submission and user management. The server is set up to handle both API requests and serve the static frontend files in production.

### Data Layer

- Drizzle ORM is used for database operations with PostgreSQL
- Database schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- The schema includes tables for users and contact form submissions

   - Response is sent back to the client
   - User sees a success message or error message

2. **Static Content Flow**:
   - Pages and components are pre-rendered
   - Animation triggers as user scrolls through the page
