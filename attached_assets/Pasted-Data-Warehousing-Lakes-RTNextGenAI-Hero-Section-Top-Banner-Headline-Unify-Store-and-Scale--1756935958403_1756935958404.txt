Why Data Warehousing & Data Lakes Matter

Todayâ€™s enterprises deal with massive volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from ERP, CRM, IoT, mobile, and cloud applications.

Data Warehouses excel at structured data (transactions, ERP, BI reporting).

Data Lakes excel at raw and semi-structured data (IoT, logs, social media, images).

The new approach is the Lakehouse â€” combining the flexibility of a data lake with the performance of a data warehouse.

RTNextGenAI builds scalable, cloud-native data platforms that support analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and real-time decision-making.
