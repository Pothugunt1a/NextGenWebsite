2. Introduction / Why It Matters

Poorly designed databases create bottlenecks, performance issues, and high costs. A solid design ensures data consistency, speed, and scalability for enterprise systems.

3. Key Capabilities (Grid)

Schema design & normalization.

Indexing strategies.

High availability (HA) architectures.

Distributed systems & replication.

4. Architecture Approaches

Relational databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).

NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB).

Hybrid architectures (polyglot persistence).

5. Design for Scalability

Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling.

Partitioning & sharding strategies.

Multi-region cloud architectures.

6. Performance Considerations

Query optimization baked into design.

Indexing strategies from the start.

Data modeling for analytics (star schema, snowflake schema).

7. Cloud-Native Design

AWS RDS, Aurora, Redshift.

Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB.

Google Cloud SQL, BigQuery.

8. Security-First Design

Role-based access control (RBAC).

Encryption at rest & in transit.

Compliance-ready architectures (HIPAA, GDPR).

9. Integration With Applications

APIs, microservices, and event-driven architectures.

ERP & CRM integration (SAP, Salesforce, NetSuite).

Data pipelines for analytics (ETL/ELT).
