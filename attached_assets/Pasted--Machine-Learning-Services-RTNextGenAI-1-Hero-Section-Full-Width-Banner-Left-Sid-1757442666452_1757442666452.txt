## 2. Why Machine Learning Matters (Business Impact)

Traditional analytics explains *what happened*. Machine Learning predicts *what will happen* and recommends *what to do next*.

With ML, enterprises can:

* Detect anomalies and risks in real time.

* Personalize customer experiences.

* Optimize operations and reduce costs.

* Power intelligent automation across industries.

* Enable advanced AI solutions like Gen AI & Agentic AI.

* **Two-Column Layout:**

  * Left: Challenges → reactive decisions, inefficiency, missed opportunities.
  * Right: Benefits → predictive insights, personalization, automation, cost savings.

* Infographic: Traditional Analytics = “What Happened” vs ML = “What Will Happen.”
