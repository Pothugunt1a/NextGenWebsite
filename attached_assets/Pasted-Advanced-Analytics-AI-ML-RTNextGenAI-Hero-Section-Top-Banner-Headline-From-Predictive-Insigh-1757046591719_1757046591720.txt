Why Advanced Analytics & AI/ML Matter

Traditional BI answers what happened. Predictive analytics shows what will happen. But Generative AI and Agentic AI go further — they can create, adapt, and act on your behalf.

Predictive Analytics → Forecast trends (sales, churn, demand).

ML & Deep Learning → Detect anomalies, classify data, recognize speech/images.

Generative AI (Gen AI) → Create new content (text, code, images, simulations).

Agentic AI → Autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and interact with other systems.

Together, these capabilities give enterprises a continuous intelligence loop — learning, generating, and acting in real time.
