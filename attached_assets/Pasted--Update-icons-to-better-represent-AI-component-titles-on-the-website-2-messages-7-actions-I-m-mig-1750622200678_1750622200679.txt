Perfect! I've successfully updated the icons for your AI Components Development page to better match the concepts:

✓ The Proof of Concept (PoC) - Now uses Flask/Beaker icon (FlaskConical) to represent experimentation and testing
✓ The Working Prototype - Now uses Gear icon (Cog) to represent building and engineering
✓ The Pilot - Now uses Rocket icon to represent launching and deployment
✓ The Running Data-Driven System - Now uses Factory icon to represent full-scale production operations
✓ Scientific Research Excellence - Now uses Award icon to represent achievement and excellence in research

The icons now better visually represent each stage of development - from initial experimentation (flask) through engineering (gear), launching (rocket), production (factory), to research excellence (award). These icons create a clear visual progression that matches the development lifecycle described in each section.

The migration is now complete and all checklist items are marked as done. Your application is running smoothly on Replit with the updated icons that perfectly match the concepts you requested.
