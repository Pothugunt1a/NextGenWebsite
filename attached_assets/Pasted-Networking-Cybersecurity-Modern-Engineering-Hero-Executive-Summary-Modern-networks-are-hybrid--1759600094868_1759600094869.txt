Networking, Cybersecurity & Modern Engineering
Hero / Executive Summary

Modern networks are hybrid, identity-centric, and relentlessly targeted. AI—especially agentic systems and generative AI—now augments SecOps, NetOps, and ITOps to compress triage from hours to minutes, auto-correlate telemetry across endpoints, identities, cloud and network, and enforce Zero Trust at scale. Safe adoption pairs AI with NIST AI RMF governance, adversary-informed defense (MITRE ATT&CK), and GenAI-specific controls (OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps).

What “AI-Driven Security & Networking” Means

AI for Security (SecOps/XDR/SIEM/SOAR). LLMs and behavioral ML summarize alerts, generate investigations, and automate responses with playbooks & agents: Microsoft Copilot for Security (GA Apr 1, 2024; pay-as-you-go), CrowdStrike Charlotte AI & the Agentic SOC (2025), SentinelOne Purple AI (agentic triage/investigation), Palo Alto Precision AI, Google Sec-Gemini (exp.).

AI for Networking (AIOps/NDR/SASE/SSE). ML baselines traffic, detects anomalies, recommends policies, and enforces micro-segmentation in AI-scale data centers (e.g., Cisco Hypershield).

Zero Trust is the control fabric. Identity-first access, continuous verification, least privilege, and data-centric policy across users, devices, apps, and networks. 
NIST Publications

Risk & governance. Adopt NIST AI RMF (Govern/Map/Measure/Manage) and OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps (2025) (prompt injection, model DoS, data poisoning, supply chain, excessive agency).

Adversary-informed defense. Map detections & responses to MITRE ATT&CK so AI output aligns to real attacker TTPs. 
MITRE ATT&CK

Data governance caution: recent research shows GenAI copilots can surface large volumes of sensitive content without tight permissions—enforce classification/labeling, least-privilege and DLP.

Diagram B — Agentic SecOps Flow (Investigation → Action)

Alerts -> AI Agent Orchestrator
  -> Summarize + correlate (LLM over SIEM/XDR)
  -> Map to ATT&CK (TTP tagging)
  -> Decide next action (policy + risk scoring)
  -> Execute (isolate, revoke, block, notify)
  -> Explainability + logs (audit/governance)
