AI chatbot FAQs
What is an AI chatbot?
An AI chatbot is a software application that uses AI to engage in a human-like conversation with real users. These chatbots are designed to simulate human interaction and can efficiently interpret and extract meaning and context, and respond to user queries using NLP.

They also learn from historical interactions to provide personalized recommendations and responses, making them great for marketing, sales, and customer service. Plus, they provide instant assistance and are available 24/7, which improves customer experience. AI chatbots can be deployed on different platforms, including customer support systems, messaging apps, and websites, to support customers every step of the way.

At AI Superior, we specialize in creating AI chatbots that streamline business operations and redefine user engagement to boost your business.
