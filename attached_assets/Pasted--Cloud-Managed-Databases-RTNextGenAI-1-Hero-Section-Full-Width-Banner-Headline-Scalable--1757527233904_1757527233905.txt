2. Introduction / Why Cloud & Managed Databases Matter

Traditional on-premises databases are costly to maintain, difficult to scale, and resource-intensive. Cloud & managed databases provide:

On-demand scalability.

Built-in automation (patching, backups, monitoring).

High availability with global replication.

Reduced operational overhead.

3. Core Capabilities (Grid)

Cloud-native database setup & configuration.

Migration to managed database services.

Monitoring & automated scaling.

Disaster recovery & multi-region deployments.

Cost optimization with usage-based models.

4. Cloud Database Platforms We Support

AWS: RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, Redshift, Neptune.

Azure: SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Synapse Analytics.

GCP: Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Firestore, Spanner.

Hybrid: On-prem + cloud DB orchestration.

5. Managed Database Services

Automated provisioning & scaling.
