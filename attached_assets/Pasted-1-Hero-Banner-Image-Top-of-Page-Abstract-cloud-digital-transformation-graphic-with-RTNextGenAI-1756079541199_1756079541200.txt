1. Hero/Banner Image (Top of Page)

Abstract cloud + digital transformation graphic with RTNextGenAI branding.

Optionally overlay the AWS logo (subtle, not dominant).

2. AWS Architecture Diagrams (Professional Icons)

Use official AWS architecture icons to show:

Migration workflows (on-prem → AWS cloud)

Serverless architecture (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)

Data lake architecture (S3 + Glue + Redshift + QuickSight)

These are recognized by technical audiences and make your site look enterprise-grade.

3. Service-Specific Illustrations

Migration – Cloud with arrows showing “lift & shift.”

Data & Analytics – Database + charts/dashboard illustration.

AI/ML – AI brain or predictive analytics graphic with AWS SageMaker branding.

DevOps – Pipeline/automation gear icons.

Healthcare – Patient data dashboard or heart/health icon.

Finance – Digital banking dashboard or padlock + dollar sign.

Retail – Shopping cart with cloud + analytics.

Manufacturing – IoT-connected machines.

5. Client Success / Metrics Image

If you highlight case studies or KPIs, you can:

Add an infographic: e.g.,

“60% Cost Reduction” (icon: dollar with down arrow).

“3X Faster Reporting” (icon: speedometer/analytics).

This gives a visual punch to success stories.

6. Certifications & Trust Badges
