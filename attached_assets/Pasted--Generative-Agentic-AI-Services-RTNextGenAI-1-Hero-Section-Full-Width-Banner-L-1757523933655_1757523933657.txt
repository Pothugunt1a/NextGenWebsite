## 2. Why Generative & Agentic AI Matter

Traditional AI analyzes data, but **Generative & Agentic AI extend intelligence further** by enabling:

* **Generative AI (Gen AI):** AI that creates text, code, images, video, audio, and synthetic data.
* **Agentic AI:** Autonomous agents that reason, plan, and execute workflows without constant human intervention.

With these capabilities, businesses can:

* Automate repetitive knowledge work.
* Generate personalized content at scale.
* Orchestrate complex workflows autonomously.
* Enhance decision-making with self-learning, adaptive agents.
