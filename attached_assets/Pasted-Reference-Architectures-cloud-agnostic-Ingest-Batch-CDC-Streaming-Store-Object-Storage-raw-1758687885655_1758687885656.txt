Reference Architectures (cloud-agnostic)

Ingest → (Batch/CDC/Streaming)
Store → Object Storage (raw/bronze), ACID Tables (silver/gold)
Transform → ELT/ETL with workflows & SQL/Notebook jobs
Serve → BI semantic layer + SQL endpoints + Feature Store
Govern → Catalog, lineage, row/column masking, tokenization
Ops → CI/CD for data, tests, observability, cost guardrails

6) Detailed Sections
A. Data Warehouse

What you get

Dimensional models (star/snowflake), conformed dimensions, governed semantic layer.

Fast aggregates, materialized views, workload isolation.

Data quality SLAs and auditability.

Typical use cases

Financial & regulatory reporting, sales pipeline dashboards, inventory & supply chain KPIs.

Key capabilities

SQL performance tuning, partitioning/clustering, role-based access, SCD handling, data vault if needed.

B. Data Lake

What you get

Low-cost, elastic storage for raw/semi-structured/streaming data.

Schema-on-read, notebooks for exploration, ML feature creation.

Batch + streaming pipelines, sandboxed experimentation.

Typical use cases

Clickstream, IoT, logs, image/audio NLP, experimentation datasets.

Key capabilities

Data zoning (Bronze/Silver/Gold), schema evolution, cost-aware lifecycle (tiering/retention), data discovery.

C. Data Lakehouse

What you get

ACID table format over the lake (Delta/Iceberg/Hudi).

Time travel, incremental upserts/merges, streaming writes.

Warehouse-quality SQL + vector/ML workloads on the same tables.

One catalog for permissions, lineage, and data products.

Typical use cases

Real-time dashboards on streaming data, ML-powered BI, unified metrics layer, feature store + batch/online inference.

Key capabilities

Table optimization (Z-order/clustering), caching, change data feed, fine-grained access control, governance at column/row level.

7) Tooling & Tech (examples)

Ingest: Fivetran, Stitch, Debezium, Kafka/Kinesis/Event Hubs, Airbyte

Transform/Orchestrate: dbt, Airflow/Composer, Fabric Data Factory, AWS Glue, Databricks Workflows

Storage & Tables: S3/ADLS/GCS + Delta/Iceberg/Hudi

Serving/BI: Power BI, Looker, Tableau, Fabric, BigQuery, Snowflake SQL endpoints

ML/AI: Databricks/Vertex/SageMaker, Feature Store, MLflow

Governance: Unity Catalog/BigQuery Data Catalog/Purview + Great Expectations/Assertions for data tests

8) Security, Compliance & Governance

Central catalog with least privilege & attribute-based access.

PII handling: tokenization, masking, encryption at rest & in transit.

Data contracts & quality rules (freshness, completeness, uniqueness).

Lineage & impact analysis; audit trails for change management.

Regs: SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI—mapped to controls and evidence.

9) Performance & Cost Controls

Right-sizing compute pools/warehouses; autoscaling with guardrails.

Storage tiering + compaction & file size tuning.

Caching, materialized views, clustering/Z-order.

Unit cost dashboards (cost per query, per job, per dataset).

Workload isolation (BI vs. ELT vs. DS).

10) Migration & Modernization (your path)

Assess: inventory sources, reports, pipelines, SLAs, and cost.

Design: target (Warehouse / Lake / Lakehouse), data model, security model, and data contracts.

Pilot: migrate 1–2 data products end-to-end; validate KPIs & costs.

Migrate: automate ELT, implement tests, swap BI sources with dual-run.

Optimize: performance tuning, governance rollout, decommission legacy.

Operate: observability, SLOs, CI/CD, FinOps.

11) Sample Packages

Warehouse QuickStart (4–6 weeks): conformed model, semantic layer, 10–15 KPIs, automated refresh, governance baseline.

Lakehouse Accelerator (6–10 weeks): Delta/Iceberg tables, streaming pipeline, dbt + tests, feature store + one ML use case.

Modernization & FinOps: cost baseline, right-sizing, tiering, caching/materialization strategy.
