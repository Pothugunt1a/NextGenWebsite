Networking, Cybersecurity & Modern Engineering
Modern networks are hybrid, identity-centric, and relentlessly targeted. AI‚Äîespecially agentic systems and generative AI‚Äînow augments SecOps, NetOps, and ITOps to compress triage from hours to minutes, auto-correlate telemetry across endpoints, identities, cloud and network, and enforce Zero Trust at scale.

Implementation Roadmap
A proven 5-phase approach to AI-augmented security transformation

Phase 1
Baseline & Governance
Stand up AI RMF roles/artifacts; classify data; inventory model/agent usage; set LLM guardrails.

Phase 2
Zero Trust Foundations
Identity-centric access; device health; least-privilege segmentation; continuous policy checks.

Phase 3
Telemetry Unification
Normalize XDR/NDR/cloud/identity/email/DNS into SIEM/XDR mapped to ATT&CK.

Phase 4
Agentic Use Cases
Start with enrichment & triage summaries; graduate to auto-isolation/revoke with human-in-the-loop.

Phase 5
AI-Native DC & SASE
Micro-segmentation + distributed enforcement for AI/ML clusters and east-west traffic.
