2. Introduction / Why Optimization Matters

Slow databases lead to lost revenue, poor user experiences, and higher infrastructure costs. Optimized databases deliver:

Faster application response times.

Reduced cloud resource consumption.

Scalability to handle growing workloads.

Improved business productivity.

3. Core Capabilities (Grid)

Query analysis & tuning.

Index optimization & partitioning.

Memory & cache configuration.

Workload balancing & sharding.

Proactive performance monitoring.

4. Query Optimization

SQL tuning for complex queries.

Execution plan analysis & rewrite.

Batch vs real-time workload balancing.

Tools: EXPLAIN, SQL Profiler, Oracle AWR Reports.

5. Indexing Strategies

Clustered vs non-clustered indexes.

Covering indexes & filtered indexes.

Index defragmentation & rebuilds.

Advanced techniques: columnstore, bitmap indexes.

6. Partitioning & Sharding

Table partitioning for large datasets.

Horizontal scaling via sharding.

Multi-region database design for global applications.

7. Memory, Caching & In-Memory Databases

Database caching (Redis, Memcached).
